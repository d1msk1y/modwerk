| patch_mutemode -- the "MUTE MODE" PERSONALIZE entry (a multi-value text option, not a
| checkbox).  Modeled on the stock LED BRIGHTNESS item (FUN_40068c80 getter / FUN_4006907c
| setter): a getter returns a char* shown in the right-hand column, a setter takes
| (delta, wrap) on the stack and clamps/wraps the value word.
|
|   MUTE MODE   0x800000dc   0 = "OT"     -> stock instant post-FX cut
|                            1 = "OTFX-T" -> patch_softmute: dry cuts, FX inserts ring tails,
|                                            and new trigs are suppressed (the -T suffix).
|                                            Was called "OT+FX" through addendum 11.
|                            2 = "DT-T"   -> patch_softmute: pure sequencer mute (Digitakt
|                                            style) -- the sounding voice rides its own amp
|                                            envelope, only new trigs are suppressed.
|                                            Was called "DT" through addendum 11.
|                            3 = "OTFX"   -> patch_softmute: hard cut + FX tails with the
|                                            SEQUENCER LEFT ALONE -- trigs keep firing and
|                                            voices keep restarting underneath, so unmuting
|                                            picks up exactly where the pattern would have
|                                            been.  The dry is cut every frame by hook 16.
|                                            2 and 3 are built only with --defsym DT_MODE=1.
|
| 0x800000dc is the same free PERSONALIZE word patch_softmute already reads as GATE, so
| 0 = a freshly-flashed unit behaves exactly like stock.
|
| PERSISTENCE.  The 0x800000xx words are VOLATILE -- boot re-images 0x80000000.. from ROM,
| so a raw `move.l %d0,MUTE_MODE` setting is lost on the next power cycle.  The durable
| store is the checksummed 'ANDY' block in battery SRAM at 0x100fff00; boot restores
| runtime 0x80000070 <- shadow 0x100fff00, memcpy length 0x64 (ends 0x800000d3 -- one byte
| short of MUTE MODE).  build_mutemode.py patches that length 0x64 -> 0x70 at all three
| restore sites (boot / validate / defaults), so 0x800000d4..df ride along; set_mutemode
| writes its shadow at 0x100fff6c (= 0x100fff00 + 0x800000dc - 0x80000070) and the
| PERSONALIZE key handler re-checksums the block for free (jmp 0x4001f23c @ 0x40069074).
| Mechanism lifted from octamax c78ff70 (hardware-confirmed there; not yet on our MKI).
|
| The renderer (FUN_40068e00) calls the getter with jsr and pushes D0 as the column text;
| D0/D1/A0/A1 are scratch.  The input handler (FUN_40068fd0) calls the setter as
| (*setter)(delta, wrap) -- delta at 4(sp), wrap at 8(sp) -- same ABI as set_notimer.
|   [YES]   -> (+1, wrap=1)   cycle with wraparound
|   [RIGHT] -> (+1, wrap=0)   clamp
|   [LEFT]  -> (-1, wrap=0)   clamp

| part 18 addendum 14: ONE persisted word, and the menu index is DERIVED from it.
|
| The modes are listed OT / OTFX / OTFX-T / DT-T (increasing "stickiness"), which is not the
| order of the GATE values patch_softmute reads.  Renumbering GATE to match is not an option:
| hook 1 tests the modes as a CHAIN, so a mode's position in that chain is its instruction
| count, and moving OTFX-T from first-tested to second-tested would silently cost it two
| instructions per frame -- enough to break its bit-identity (one is enough; measured).
|
| Addendum 12 solved that with a SECOND word holding the menu index.  That was a mistake: two
| independently-persisted words can disagree, and on the user's first flash they did -- a unit
| coming from an older build had a GATE value stored but no menu index, so the menu could show
| one mode while the firmware ran another.  There is now ONE persisted word (GATE) and the
| menu index is computed from it every time it is needed:
|
|   GATE 0 "OT"  <-> UI 0        GATE 2 "DT-T"   <-> UI 3
|   GATE 1 "OTFX-T" <-> UI 2     GATE 3 "OTFX"   <-> UI 1
|
| ui_to_gate[] and gate_to_ui[] are inverses of each other; both are 4 bytes and both are read
| only by the getter/setter, i.e. once per key press.  The audio path pays nothing.
|
| DEFAULTS.  A unit with no valid battery data boots with 0x800000dc = 0 = "OT" -- verified in
| the emulator by booting with no poke at all and dumping the word and its shadow (both zero).
| That is also what an OS UPGRADE leaves behind, since it resets PERSONALIZE.
|
| PERSISTENCE.  The 0x800000xx words are VOLATILE -- boot re-images 0x80000000.. from ROM, so
| a raw `move.l %d0,GATE` is lost on the next power cycle.  The durable store is the
| checksummed 'ANDY' block in battery SRAM at 0x100fff00: boot restores runtime 0x80000070 <-
| shadow 0x100fff00 with memcpy length 0x64 (ending 0x800000d3, one byte short of GATE), and
| this build patches that length 0x64 -> 0x70 at all three restore sites so 0x800000d4..df
| ride along.  set_mutemode writes its shadow at 0x100fff6c (= 0x100fff00 + (GATE -
| 0x80000070)) and the PERSONALIZE key handler re-checksums the block for free
| (jmp 0x4001f23c @ 0x40069074).
| DT_MODE (the four-mode MUTE MODE) is what every build ships, so it is the default here
| rather than only a --defsym: octabam's Linked units cannot pass symbols, and this way they
| assemble the same bytes as tools/build_mute_modes.py.
