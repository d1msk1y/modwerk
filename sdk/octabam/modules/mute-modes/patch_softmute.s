| patch_softmute V7 -- audio-track mute (and, V7, SOLO silencing) behave like a single STOP:
| the sample audio cuts (fast clean fade), the track's FX inserts ring their delay/reverb
| tails out, and a silenced track's sequencer trigs make no sound.
|
| Session 9 (V1-V6): the mute case.  Session 11 (V7): the SOLO case, same technique.
| *** 20 Sep 2026 (part 18 addendum 5): the user RETRACTS Session 11's solo hardware
| confirmation -- solo was never properly tested. On hardware SOLO currently ignores
| MUTE MODE entirely and always gives an OT-style hard cut with no FX tails. The solo
| handling below (p1_solo) is therefore UNVERIFIED on hardware, not working-as-shipped.
|
| Session 12 (--defsym DT_MODE=1): a third MUTE MODE, "DT".  DT mute is a pure *sequencer*
| mute -- exactly like a Digitakt trig mute: the voice that is already sounding keeps playing
| under its OWN amp envelope (fades, sustains, or loops forever, whatever the AMP page says),
| its FX ring, and only NEW trigs are suppressed while the track is silenced.  Mechanism:
| the same D5-bit clearing as OT+FX (so FUN_40004db8 keeps every frame level word -> the
| voice + FX still reach the mix untouched) and the same `mt_trig` new-trig drop, but WITHOUT
| the FUN_40008f84 note-off / DAT_8000184a hold that OT+FX uses to fade the dry signal.
| GATE (0x800000dc) == 2 selects it.  DT_MODE is compile-gated so a plain build is unchanged.
|
| Mechanism (confirmed on hardware, MKI): FUN_40004dbc (entry FUN_40004db8) is the per-frame
| DSP-frame builder.  It branches on the SOLO flag 0x80000037:
|   - not solo:  per track, if _DAT_80000008 bit 8+t (muted) -> `clr.w` the frame level word.
|   - solo:      per track, if _DAT_80000008 bit t (0..7) set (SOLOED) -> keep; else the level
|                words get AND-ed with 0 (d1, "any track soloed?") -> silenced.  A non-soloed
|                track that is ALSO muted -> `clr.l` instead.
| Either way the silencing is a post-FX cut that also kills the FX return.
|
| _DAT_80000008 layout:  bits 0..7 = per-track SOLO   bits 8..15 = MUTE   bits 16..23 = CUE.
|
| Session 56 (NOT YET HARDWARE-VALIDATED, DSP-level A/B still pending): a FOURTH hook,
| `mt_ctr` @ 0x4000f834 -- see its own header comment below. `mt_trig`/`mt_rebind` were
| both dynamically PROVEN (ot_emu --watch-pc, real BOTLI retrig) to fire exactly as
| designed, on the exact retrig that still leaks audio -- neither gates DSP restart.
| `mt_ctr` gates the ONE remaining unconditional per-trig write this session could find
| that hook 3's own function (FUN_4000f450) makes past its own detour site: a bump of the
| SAME per-track trig counter hook 2 was built around, from a completely different,
| ungated call path (every repeat trig of an already-bound voice -- T1's exact case).
|
| Four hooks, one cave:
|
| part 18 addendum 10: every hook below used to require SOLO_FLAG (0x80000037) to be set
| before it would consider the solo mask. Stock does NOT work that way -- its own not-solo
| branch (0x40004e3a..) builds D1 = (D5.low8 == 0) ? -1 : 0 and ANDs every non-soloed
| track's level word with it, so ONE solo bit silences the rest whether or not the flag is
| set. The flag test has been removed everywhere; "silenced" now means, exactly as stock
| means it: muted, OR (something is soloed AND this track is not).
|
|  1. `pre`   @ 0x40004dc6 (the displaced `move.l 0x80000008,D5`).  With MUTE MODE == OT+FX,
|     compute the "silenced" audio-track set for this frame:
|         not solo   -> silenced = mute mask (bits 8..15 -> 0..7)
|         solo + >=1 track soloed -> silenced = every non-soloed audio track
|         solo + none soloed      -> silenced = 0  (stock: nothing is cut yet)
|     Then:
|       - keep the frame level words for the silenced tracks by clearing the bits FUN_40004dbc
|         tests in D5 (not solo: clear the mute bits; solo: clear bits 0..15 so every track is
|         kept and the "any soloed?" AND-mask D1 becomes -1) -> FX inserts still reach the mix.
|       - every frame: DAT_8000184a |= silenced   (hold the note-off; the DSP runs the release)
|       - 0->1 edge vs the patch-RAM shadow: FUN_40008f84(t) once per newly-silenced track.
|     MUTE MODE == OT clears the shadow and bails -> byte-for-byte stock.
|
|  2. `mt_trig` @ 0x40006844 (the real per-trig voice starter -- NOT FUN_40005178/
|     trig_to_voice, an unrelated code path proven dead-for-this-purpose by dynamic
|     tracing; see the hook's own header comment below for the full trail).  For a
|     silenced audio track, returns before the active-clear / trig-counter bump /
|     FUN_4000672c call that actually restarts the sample -> no 1-frame attack blip.
|     Isolation-tested AND dynamically proven against real playback in the CPU-only
|     emulator: 100% "silenced" branch taken for a muted track, FUN_4000672c called
|     ZERO times. Flashed anyway: HW showed NO CHANGE (blip and DT both unaffected,
|     both STATIC and FLEX). The CPU-only emulator cannot see the DSP at all -- see
|     hook 3 below for the working hypothesis and caveat.
|
|  3. `mt_rebind` @ 0x4000f4dc (the arena-pointer rebind that runs on EVERY trig,
|     unconditionally, one level up the call chain from mt_trig -- see its own header
|     comment below).  Working hypothesis, NOT emulator-provable: the DSP may watch
|     THIS write, not anything mt_trig gates, as its own independent "(re)bind and
|     play" signal. For a silenced audio track, skips both writes so the voice
|     struct's arena pointers stay unchanged.
|
| _DAT_80000008 itself is never written, so the MUTE/SOLO LEDs and pattern-stored state work.

| ---- SIDE-CHAIN KEY tracks keep stock's mute (Session 116) --------------------------------
| A track that some COMPRESSOR uses as its SIDE-CHAIN KEY must keep producing audio while it is
| muted -- that is the whole "ghost kick" use, and SC LISTEN (MON) auditions exactly that
| audio.  Every soft mode silences the voice BEFORE SIDE-CHAIN's tap (OTFX-T note-off + trig
| drop, DT-T trig drop, OTFX zeroes VOL/XVOL), so the key went silent (measured: the key
| buffer holds 0 for a muted T2 in GATE 1/2/3, the full signal in GATE 0).  So a key track is
| muted the way OT mutes it, in every MUTE MODE: taken OUT of the silenced set (no note-off,
| no trig drop, no VOL cut) and given back its D5 mute bit, so stock's frame builder cuts its
| level words post-FX -- which is also exactly what OT does, and why OT kept the key.
| KEY is read from this frame's per-track DSP record (half 0, 0x80000110 + t*64): FX1 id =
| low byte of halfword 27 (+55), FX2 id = +57; COMPRESSOR = 0x18; its KEY (page-2 slot 8,
| r6+$d bits 16-23 on the DSP) = high byte of halfword 19 (+38, FX1) / 25 (+50, FX2),
| 0 = OFF, 1..8 = T1..T8.  KEYMASK is left for the five trig hooks, which let a key track's
| trigs through.  %a0 is the caller's: pushed/popped.  %d0/%d1/%d3 are hook 1's own.
| Assembled only with --defsym SC_KEY=1, i.e. in an image that also carries SIDE-CHAIN
| (build_kyoti.py sets it).  Standalone MUTE MODE has no KEY -- stock COMPRESSOR's page-2 slot
| 8 is unused and could hold anything -- and without SC_KEY this file assembles byte-for-byte
| as it did before Session 116.

                                         | its own amp envelope, OTFX because the voice must keep
                                         | playing untouched (the playhead has to stay where the
                                         | pattern puts it) while hook 16 zeroes the dry instead.
                                         | `bcs` rather than `bne` keeps the instruction count
                                         | identical for GATE 1 and GATE 2.

| ---- OTFX (GATE 3): the DRY HARD CUT ------------------------------------------------
| OTFX is DT's frame handling (level words left open so the inserts keep ringing, no
| note-off, no REL_STATE) plus this: every frame, zero a silenced track's dry L/R gains.
| Hooks 2/3/9/10/15 all PASS for GATE 3, so trigs fire and voices restart exactly as on
| stock -- measured, the live playhead reaches stock's own 0x31e1 rather than the 0x14be1
| the trig-masking modes reach -- and unmuting therefore picks up where the pattern would
| have been.  The track is silent because its dry gain is zero, not because the sequencer
| was stopped.
|
| WHERE THE DRY IS.  The per-track DSP parameter block is 0x80000110 + sel*512 + track*64;
| its +2/+4 are the dry L/R gains (established on HARDWARE in Session 58 -- see hook 8's
| header: with only +2 zeroed the leak is dry, one channel only, and panning BAL into the
| zeroed channel silences the track).  Measured this session with --watch-mem: the level
| chain rewrites +2 (0x4000ced4) and +4 (0x4000cb4e/0x4000cc20/0x4000ced0) EVERY frame for
| both halves, so the cut must be re-applied every frame -- and must NOT be keyed on
| REL_STATE, which is exactly the race that sank hooks 8/11/13 and which would leak one
| frame of full-level dry on every trig in the one mode where trigs never stop.
|
| ⚠ WHY IT LIVES HERE, in hook 1's cave, and not at its natural site.  The obvious place is
| the head of stock's own per-track release loop (0x4000d0b4, a clean 6-byte fit).  That was
| built and MEASURED, and it fails this project's own bit-identity rule: a detour there with
| a PURE NO-OP body -- replay the two displaced instructions, jump back, zero logic -- still
| perturbs the render in every mode (max|diff| 1032338 at GATE 0, 1347105 at GATE 2, against
| a build proven bit-identical to itself).  The detour itself is the cost, so no amount of
| tuning inside that cave can recover it.  Riding hook 1's EXISTING per-frame detour costs
| the other modes nothing at all except the single not-taken `bhi` above, which DT-T pays.
|
| %d0-%d3 are ours (hook 1 saved them on entry); %d5 is the function's own displaced
| MUTE_STATE and is untouched; %a0 is the caller's and is pushed/popped, on this path only.
| Both ping-pong halves are zeroed (+0/+0x200) so this needs no knowledge of `sel`.
p1_otfx:
| OTFX (GATE 3) = DT-T's frame handling -- the level words are already left open by the
| shared path above, so the inserts keep reaching the mix and ring their tails -- plus this:
| every frame, zero a silenced track's dry L/R gains.  No note-off, no REL_STATE, and none
| of the trig-masking hooks (2/3/9/10/15 all PASS for GATE 3), so trigs fire and voices
| restart exactly as on stock.  MEASURED: the live playhead reaches stock's own 0x31e1
| rather than the 0x14be1 the trig-masking modes reach, which is precisely "playback picks
| up where it would have been had we never muted".  The track is silent because its dry gain
| is zero, not because the sequencer was stopped.
|
| WHERE THE DRY IS: the per-track DSP parameter block is 0x80000110 + sel*512 + track*64,
| and its +2/+4 are the dry L/R gains (established on HARDWARE in Session 58 -- see hook 8's
| header).  Measured this session with --watch-mem: the level chain rewrites +2 (0x4000ced4)
| and +4 (0x4000cb4e/0x4000cc20/0x4000ced0) EVERY frame for both halves, so the cut must be
| re-applied every frame, and must NOT be keyed on REL_STATE -- that race is what sank hooks
| 8/11/13, and in the one mode where trigs never stop it would leak a frame of full-level dry
| on every trig.  Both ping-pong halves are zeroed, so this needs no knowledge of `sel`.
|
| %d2 (the silenced set) and %d5 are already computed by the shared path; %d0-%d3 are hook
| 1's own saved registers; %a0 belongs to the caller and is pushed/popped on this path only.
| WHICH WORDS, BISECTED WITH RENDERS -- and CORRECTED after a hardware report.
|
| The first version of this cut zeroed bytes 2..15, on the strength of an audio bisection
| alone: every range containing +6 or +10 silenced the track and let the tail ring out, and
| +2/+4 were "known" to be the dry L/R gains from hook 8's hardware result.  IT SHIPPED AND
| IT WAS WRONG.  The user flashed it and reported OTFX behaving exactly like OTFX-T, and the
| test that had never been run -- an actual UNMUTE -- reproduced it at once:
|
|   mute at frame 5532, UNMUTE at 9500 (between trigs; the next trig is at 10335)
|                             silent while muted    audio at the unmute, +0/+40/+80 ms
|     OT (stock, the target)        yes             0.0633  0.0653  0.0654
|     cut 2..6   (the dry pair)     yes             0.0000  0.0000  0.0000   <-- FREEZES it
|     cut 6..8   (+6 alone)         yes             0.0621  0.0653  0.0654   <-- correct
|     cut 10..12 (+10 alone)        yes             0.0621  0.0653  0.0654   <-- correct
|     cut 2..15  (what shipped)     yes             0.0000  0.0000  0.0000   <-- FREEZES it
|
| So +2/+4 do NOT merely scale the dry: zeroing them stops the voice ADVANCING, and playback
| cannot resume mid-sample afterwards -- which is precisely the property OTFX exists for.
| +6 and +10 silence the voice upstream of the insert while leaving it running, so the tail
| rings out AND the unmute picks up where the pattern would have been.  Both are cut, for
| symmetry: each is independently sufficient here, but this project has been bitten before by
| a stereo pair where stock zeroed one side and clamped the other (hook 8), and a centred
| test project cannot tell an L/R pair from a redundant one.
|
| ⚠ The lesson, at cost: an audio bisection answered "what silences the track" and I read it
| as "what cuts the dry".  The defining property of this mode was never measured until the
| user's hardware said otherwise -- the emulator evidence for it was a ColdFire-side playhead
| counter, which kept advancing while the DSP-side voice did not.  Measure the PROPERTY, not
| a proxy for it.

| ============================ hook 2: FUN_40006844 (the real per-trig voice starter) ==========
| Session ?? part 1 (HW-reported: DT did nothing at all; OT+FX's trig blip, believed fixed, was
| back): hook 2 used to detour FUN_40005178, on the theory (from an old, out-of-context Ghidra
| decompile) that `trig_to_voice` -> FUN_40005178 was the sequencer's per-trig voice-start path.
| WRONG, proven by driving the real firmware in the full-firmware emulator (refs/octabam): 79
| real trigs fired across 6s of playback and FUN_40005178 was entered ZERO times; neither of the
| two "voice command mailbox" addresses its own body writes was ever touched. That whole
| mechanism is unrelated to ordinary sequenced trigs -- the old hook there was harmless dead
| code from this scenario's point of view, which is exactly why reflashing it changed nothing.
|
| Session ?? part 2 -- the REAL path, found by tracing the actual trig flag write
| (`FW_LIVE_NIBBLE` 0x46104d15) back through real execution, not by re-reading decompiles:
| a real trig reaches `FUN_40006820(track)` (an 8-track fan-out: track<8 falls straight through
| to the real work below; track==8 recurses over 0..7) which falls into the genuine per-track
| body at **FUN_40006844**. That function: raises the CPU's IPL (`movew sr,d2` / `movew
| #0x2700,sr`), clears the voice struct's `active` byte (`VOICE_BASE+track*0xA8`), bumps a
| per-track trig counter (`VOICE_BASE+track*0xA8+0x90` -- confirmed dynamically: this exact
| location increments 1,2,3,4,... on every real trig), then calls FUN_4000672c (which restarts
| the sample's amp/settings state -- the actual "make sound" step) before restoring the saved
| SR and returning. Nowhere in this chain is MUTE_STATE ever tested. This is confirmed the real
| dispatch by TWO independent dynamic traces landing on the same code (a PC-trace burst right
| after a real trig, and a direct memory-write watch on the voice struct's trig counter).
|
| Fix: detour FUN_40006844's own entry -- its first two instructions, `movew sr,d2` (2 B) +
| `movew #0x2700,sr` (4 B), are exactly 6 B, a coincidental perfect fit for our `jmp abs.l`
| detour, same convention as every other hook in this project. For a silenced audio track,
| `rts` immediately -- BEFORE the active-clear, the counter bump, or the FUN_4000672c call that
| actually restarts the sample -- so there is nothing left to produce even a one-frame blip.
| For everything else (not muted, not an audio track, MUTE MODE == OT, or any solo case that
| doesn't apply), replay the two displaced instructions and resume normal execution. `%d1`
| (the track number, live across this whole function) is never touched by this hook; `%d0` is
| free to clobber (the original code reloads it immediately after); `%d3` is saved/restored
| around the check purely out of caution since its liveness here isn't otherwise established.
|
| Session ??-ter (caught by dynamic full-firmware validation, NOT flashed): FUN_40006844 is
| reached from FUN_40006820's OWN body via a plain conditional branch (`bccs`), not a fresh
| call -- so FUN_40006820's prologue (`movel a2,-(sp) ; movel d2,-(sp)`) is STILL live on the
| stack at this point, underneath the real return address, and its epilogue
| (`movel sp@+,d2 ; moveal sp@+,a2 ; rts`) is what finally unwinds it. An early `rts` that
| only pops our own scratch push leaves those 2 extra longs on the stack, so `rts` jumps to
| garbage instead of the real caller -- crashed the emulator instantly under real playback
| (`unhandled exception 4` / illegal instruction) even though the isolated unit test passed
| (it entered mt_trig directly, with no simulated FUN_40006820 stack frame beneath it, so it
| never exercised this). `mt_silenced` must pop the SAME 2 longs the real epilogue would.

| ============================ hook 3: 0x4000f4dc (the arena-pointer rebind) ============
| Session ??-quater: mt_trig, isolation-tested AND dynamically proven (real playback,
| direct instrumentation) to take the silenced branch 100% of the time and to reduce
| FUN_4000672c's call count for a muted track to exactly zero, was flashed and STILL
| made no audible difference -- blip unchanged, DT still silent, with BOTH STATIC and
| FLEX tested. This ColdFire-only emulator has no DSP model at all, so everything
| mt_trig fixed is real and CPU-side-true, but invisible to whatever actually gates
| DSP playback. Working hypothesis: the DSP watches this write, not FUN_40006844's own
| CPU-side machinery.
|
| Every real trig unconditionally rewrites the voice struct's arena-entry pointers here
| (`+4`/`+8`, `VOICE_BASE + track*0xA8`) to point at the FLEX/STATIC arena slot this
| track's machine currently resolves to -- no MUTE_STATE test anywhere in the caller
| (`0x4000f454`-ish). If the DSP treats THIS pointer write as its own independent
| "(re)bind and play" edge -- plausible, since it is the only DSP-visible state that
| changes on every trig regardless of what FUN_40006844/FUN_4000672c do -- then leaving
| it unconditional would explain a real trig producing sound no matter what mt_trig
| does purely on the CPU side.
|
| This hook is deliberately narrow: rather than bail out of `0x4000f454`'s own large,
| multi-register prologue (`lea sp@(-60),sp` + `moveml d2-d7/a2-fp,sp@` -- a much bigger,
| riskier frame than FUN_40006844's simple 2-push case that already bit us once), it
| detours only the two write instructions themselves (`movel a5,a2@(4)` /
| `movel a4,a2@(8)`, 8 B total -- room for a 6 B `jmp` + 2 B spare). For a silenced
| track, skip BOTH writes -- the voice struct's arena pointers simply keep whatever they
| already had (0/stale if never yet unmuted, which is the correct "no sound" state
| anyway) -- and resume normal execution. `%a5`/`%a4` (the freshly computed arena
| addresses) are UNCHANGED either way, so the rest of this function's own "does this
| need a fresh FUN_40006820 bind" decision (which reads `%a5@`, a register, not the
| memory this hook gates) is completely unaffected -- mt_trig's own protection there
| stays fully intact regardless of what this hook does.
|
| The track number is read from `(0x40,%sp)` -- the SAME stack argument the original
| code already used for this exact purpose a few instructions earlier (confirmed: the
| stack pointer is untouched by anything between that read and this site, so the slot
| is still valid). `%d0`/`%d1` are freely clobberable here (neither is read by the
| original code again before being freshly redefined, on either the silenced-skip path
| or the resumed-original path).
|
| Caveat, stated plainly: unlike `mt_trig`, this hook's actual effect on real audio
| cannot be verified in this CPU-only emulator at all -- there is no DSP to observe. It
| is a well-reasoned next guess grounded in what IS provably true (this write is the
| one DSP-relevant state change mt_trig does not gate), not a decisively proven fix.

| ---------------- hooks 4-7: TRIED, MEASURED, RULED OUT (Session 56 / 57) ---------------
| Removed from this file to keep the cave small (they also pushed the PERSONALIZE arrays
| out of their usual home and made cross-build comparisons noisy).  Full reasoning, the
| measurements, and the exact detour bytes for each are in NOTES.md, Sessions 56-57:
|
|   mt_ctr  0x4000f834  gate the reuse-path per-track trig counter  -> made the blip LOUDER
|   mt_pos  0x4000f790  gate the six START/END position writes      -> completely inert
|   mt_ptr  0x4000f820  gate the play-pointer writes                -> completely inert
|   fxcut   0x40004e9e  cut the frame builder's per-track word C    -> wrong producer, inert
|   (plus `--defsym ALWAYS_NOTEOFF=1` in hook 1: note-off every frame rather than on the
|    mute edge -> inert on the blip AND a regression on the ordinary mute)
|
| All five aimed at stopping the retriggered VOICE.  The voice was never the problem --
| see hook 8.
|
| ============================ hook 13: 0x4000d0c2 (REL_STATE RACE + the unmuted-envelope
| ==== regression, both closed -- SHADOW is now the ONLY signal, GATE/REL_STATE are not) ===
| Session 58 continued yet again, part 8: first version of this hook only handled the case
| "REL_STATE wrongly says not-silenced but SHADOW says muted" (the original race), by
| falling into `relcut` (hook 8, below) UNCHANGED whenever REL_STATE's own bit was set.
| Session 58 continued yet again, part 10: FLASHED, and the user reported ordinary,
| completely UNMUTED playback in OT+FX/DT mode had shortened envelopes -- "amp hold
| reduced to trig length". Root cause, found by testing `relcut` ALONE (no hook 13 at all,
| the pre-existing hardware-good baseline) against a track with real content, nothing
| muted, GATE toggled 0 vs 1: **`relcut` zeros the second level word (+4) for ANY track
| whose REL_STATE bit is set and GATE != 0 -- it never checks whether THAT SPECIFIC track
| is actually muted.** REL_STATE ("voice t in RELEASE") is a stock, per-voice indicator
| that goes high for ordinary natural decay, muted or not; `relcut`'s own Session-58 header
| comment even says the fix is meant for "ANY silenced track" but the code only ever
| checked the GLOBAL GATE, not per-track mute state. Confirmed directly
| (`tools/diag_relcut_unmuted.py` against `out/mainos_mute_modes_BASELINE.bin`, hook 13
| not even present): 8267 of 8268 writes to +4 were VALUE 0, starting 2 frames after a
| single natural trig, with MUTE_STATE at 0 for the entire run. **This predates hook 13
| entirely** -- every build since Session 58 has had it; it was simply never tested with
| nothing muted before.
|
| This is a SECOND, independent bug from the original race, and the RIGHT fix folds both
| into one: make `SHADOW` (`pre`'s own independently-maintained, per-frame, per-track mute
| set -- NEVER read by `relcut`'s old logic at all) the ONLY thing that decides whether a
| track's dry signal gets force-muted. `REL_STATE` still matters, but ONLY for reproducing
| STOCK's own pre-existing natural-release clamp for a track that is genuinely NOT muted --
| exactly what un-modified stock already does, byte for byte. This also means the GLOBAL
| GATE check disappears entirely: `pre` (hook 1) already clears `SHADOW` to 0 every single
| frame whenever GATE is not OT+FX/DT ("OT (or unknown): stock; keep the shadow clean for
| later" -- hook 1's own header), so a `SHADOW`-only design AUTOMATICALLY reproduces true
| stock behaviour in GATE=0 with no separate check needed.
|
| Mechanism, read directly off this loop's own disassembly (`m68k-elf-objdump -m
| m68k:cfv4e`):
|
|   4000d0ba:  mvzb 0x8000184a,%d0   | REL_STATE, loaded ONCE per frame
|   4000d0c0:  asrl #1,%d0          | this track's bit -> Carry, OUTSIDE this detour
|   4000d0c2:  bccs 0x4000d0d6      | stock: carry CLEAR -> skip; carry SET -> old relcut
|   4000d0d6:  lea %a0@(64),%a0     | shared tail: next track (+0x40), loop back
|
| New decision tree, entirely SHADOW-driven:
|   SHADOW bit SET (genuinely muted, regardless of REL_STATE) -> force +2/+43/+4 all to 0.
|   SHADOW bit CLEAR (genuinely not muted):
|     REL_STATE bit was CLEAR (not releasing either) -> do nothing, exact stock skip.
|     REL_STATE bit was SET (genuine natural release)  -> replicate STOCK's OWN original
|       behaviour exactly: zero the dry word, CLAMP (not zero) the route word to 6144.
|
| Track index from %a0, as before: `((%a0 - 0x80000110) >> 6) & 7`. `%d3` confirmed free
| (hook 8's and hook 11's own header comments). `%d4` ALSO confirmed free this session:
| scanned forward to 0x4000d124 (`moveb 0x8000184b,%d4`) with zero reads of %d4 anywhere in
| between -- a fresh load before any use, proving no live value crosses this detour in it.
| `scs %d4` captures REL_STATE's own carry bit into %d4 (0xFF/0x00) BEFORE the SHADOW-index
| arithmetic gets a chance to disturb the flags -- `scs`/`scc` read condition codes without
| writing them, so this is safe where a plain conditional branch immediately after would
| not be. Branches on `btst`'s own Z flag immediately, before restoring %d3 (the same
| flag-clobber class of bug relcut's own header comment already documents once: `move.l
| (sp)+,%d3` sets N/Z from the popped value and clears V/C).
|
| `relcut`'s OWN body (hook 8, below) is now DEAD CODE -- no longer reached by anything,
| stock or this hook. Left in place, unreferenced, per this project's own convention for
| superseded-but-documented attempts (see hook 11's `relstate_or`) rather than deleted.
|
| REPLACES hook 8's own standalone stock-side detour, same as the part-8 version: span
| 0x4000d0c2..0x4000d0d6 (20 B), expected-bytes = relcut's stock string with `6412`
| prepended -- see the build script's PATCHES list.
|
| VALIDATED this session (NOTES.md "part 10"): (1) unmuted, GATE=0, byte-identical to
| stock (SHADOW==0 always, untouched); (2) unmuted, GATE=1, a genuinely-not-muted track
| with real content -- the route word is CLAMPED to 6144 on natural release, matching true
| stock, NOT zeroed (the bug this version fixes); (3) muted, multi-retrig, both pings, both
| modes -- the original race stays closed (SHADOW catches the momentary wrong REL_STATE
| answer exactly as the part-8 version did).

| ============================ hook 8: 0x4000d0c4 (the ASYMMETRIC L/R MUTE) ==============
| ⚠ DEAD CODE as of Session 58 continued yet again, part 10 -- hook 13 (relstate_shadow)
| above no longer jumps here at all; its own SHADOW-driven logic replicates what this hook
| was trying to do (and fixes the bug this hook's GATE-only check had: it never checked
| whether the SPECIFIC track was actually muted, so it zeroed +4 for ANY track's ordinary
| natural release once MUTE MODE was on at all -- see hook 13's header for the full story
| and NOTES.md "part 10"). Left in place, unreferenced, per this project's convention for
| superseded-but-documented attempts rather than deleted -- do not re-wire this in as-is.
| Session 58 -- corrected by a hardware report.  The stock per-track loop at
| 0x4000d0a4..0x4000d0dc, driven by REL_STATE (0x8000184a -- the byte `pre` maintains):
|
|   4000d0b6:  movew #6144,%d2           | the cap
|   4000d0ba:  mvzb 0x8000184a,%d0       | REL_STATE
|   4000d0c0:  asrl #1,%d0 / bccs        | per track: silenced this frame?
|   4000d0c4:  clrw  %a0@(2)             | YES -> one channel := 0
|   4000d0c8:  clrb  %a0@(43)
|   4000d0cc:  cmpw  %a0@(4),%d2         | the OTHER channel: if 6144 > it, leave it,
|   4000d0d0:  bgts  0x4000d0d6          | otherwise clamp it DOWN TO 6144 -- never to 0
|   4000d0d2:  movew %d2,%a0@(4)
|
| Session 57 read +2/+4 as "dry" and "a second route (the FX-tail feature)", and gated the
| fix on a retrig.  HARDWARE SAYS OTHERWISE, and is unambiguous: with a muted track
| blipping, **only the LEFT channel blips, the right is silent, the blip is DRY (not
| effected) audio, and turning BAL fully right silences the track completely.**
|
| So +2 and +4 are the per-track **L and R gains of the dry signal** -- a stereo pair,
| computed upstream by the pan/balance maths at ~0x4000cf84..0x4000d022.  Stock zeroes ONE
| of them and merely CLAMPS the other to 6144.  That asymmetry IS the bug, and it is why
| panning into the zeroed channel makes the track fall silent.  Nothing here is the FX-tail
| mechanism at all: the tail rings via hook 1's own D5-bit clearing, on a different set of
| words entirely, which is exactly why the user hears the FX ring correctly while the dry
| leaks.
|
| Fix, accordingly, is simpler than Session 57's: zero +4 the same way stock already zeroes
| +2, for ANY silenced track.  No retrig detection, no HARDCUT byte, no dependency on
| mt_rebind firing -- all of which Session 57 needed only because it thought +4 was a
| feature worth preserving.  It is not; it is the other half of the same mute.
|
| Gated on MUTE MODE so stock (OT) behaviour is byte-for-byte untouched: REL_STATE is a
| STOCK byte that stock sets for voices in their natural release, and stock's clamp on
| those is existing shipped behaviour that must not change.
|
| Detours 18 B (0x4000d0c4..0x4000d0d6).  0x4000d0d6 is a branch target (from the `bccs` at
| 0x4000d0c2 and the `bgts` at 0x4000d0d0) but it is the END of the span, so nothing lands
| inside it.  %d0 is the shifted REL_STATE and %d1/%d2/%a0 are the loop's own state, so %d0
| is saved and restored around the GATE read rather than clobbered.

| ============================ hook 9: 0x4000d498 (DROP THE TRIG ENTIRELY) ===============
| Session 58, at the user's direction: "these are supposed to be trig mute-style modes --
| concentrate on finding a way to simply mute all trigs encountered after the mute."
| Session 58 continued: hardware confirmed this FIXES DT with no desync found. OT+FX,
| flashed alongside it with only `relcut` (hook 8), STILL blipped on one channel -- the
| exact same symptom as before hook 8, unchanged. Broadened this hook to cover OT+FX too.
|
| Why `relcut` alone isn't enough for OT+FX: hook 8 only reacts to the per-track LEVEL
| WORD, which is control-rate (updated once per sequencer frame) and was independently
| confirmed, frame by frame across the retrig, to read 0/0 the entire time -- so the
| ColdFire-side mixer gain is provably never wrong. But `relcut` does nothing to stop the
| trig from reaching the voice engine, and the voice engine's OWN restart is exactly what
| hooks 2-6 (Session 56) spent a whole session failing to gate from the outside. A DSP-
| side voice can plausibly reach its own default/unity gain for the first few samples of
| a restart, entirely below the granularity this per-frame level word can see or fix --
| which is consistent with DT (which prevents the restart from ever happening at all)
| working cleanly while OT+FX (which only cleans up the CONTROL-RATE word around it)
| still blips. OT+FX's own hook-1 header has said "a silenced track's sequencer trigs
| make no sound" since Session 9 -- this hook is what actually delivers that, for both
| modes, by removing the restart itself rather than reacting to its level word.
|
| Every earlier DT attempt tried to stop the voice AFTER its trig had been dispatched
| (mt_trig at FUN_40006844, mt_rebind inside FUN_4000f450, the whole Session-56 family).
| DT did nothing at all on hardware.  This hook stops the trig being dispatched at all.
|
| ⚠ FIRST ATTEMPT WAS WRONG, and the emulator caught it before the flash: `grep "jsr
| 0x4000f450"` finds exactly ONE direct call, at 0x4000421c, so that looked like the single
| choke point.  Detouring it produced ZERO hits in a real run while FUN_4000f450 itself was
| entered 7 times -- because the live path does not use that direct call at all.  The return
| address on FUN_4000f450's own stack (`--watch-pc 0x4000f450`, first stack word = 0x4000d49e,
| with a0 == 0x4000f450 on entry) gave up the real site: an INDIRECT `jsr %a0@` two bytes
| earlier, at 0x4000d49c.  Lesson worth keeping: a grep for direct calls does not find a
| function-pointer dispatch; ask the callee's own return address instead.
|
| The real dispatch, 0x4000d47a..0x4000d4ce:
|
|   4000d47a:  mvsb %d1,%d4              | d4 = this track's MACHINE TYPE

|   4000d4ce:  lea %sp@(12),%sp          | the caller pops all three args itself
|
| Hooking the DISPATCH rather than one handler means every machine type is covered, not
| just the FLEX/STATIC one FUN_4000f450 serves -- which is what a trig mute should do.
|
| For a silenced track we simply do not call the handler.  The three arguments are still
| pushed (so the caller's own `lea %sp@(12),%sp` still balances), and %d0 is set to 0 --
| the value the following code ORs into a per-track word at 0x4000d4ae, i.e. "this handler
| did nothing".  %d3 (track) is live afterwards and is never touched; %d0/%d1 are free
| (%d0 is the handler's return value by convention, %d1 is reloaded at 0x4000d49e).
|
| Net effect: a trig on a silenced track is never dispatched -- no voice start, no arena
| bind, no position write.  A voice ALREADY sounding is not touched at all, so it keeps
| ringing under its own amp envelope.  That is exactly a Digitakt trig mute.
|
| The silenced test is `mr_silence`'s, copied verbatim, so this is solo-aware for free.
|
| BOTH OT+FX and DT now (Session 58 continued -- see the broadening note above).  `relcut`
| (hook 8) still does its own job for OT+FX (the already-sounding voice's dry level and
| its clean fade on mute-engage); this hook additionally stops any NEW trig from reaching
| the voice engine at all, in either mode, which is what actually fixed the blip.
|
| ⚠ UNPROVEN RISK, flagged deliberately: if the handler performs bookkeeping that later
| code depends on (a playhead, a slot lifetime, a counter), skipping it could desync that
| state -- most plausibly on UNMUTE, or after many suppressed trigs.  Test that
| specifically.  Confirmed clean for DT on hardware this session; OT+FX not yet re-tested
| with this broadened gate.

| ============================ hook 10: 0x40006820 (THE FRESH-VOICE-BIND ENTRY) ==========
| Session 58 continued -- hardware report: OT+FX blips once per trig position during the
| FIRST sequencer cycle after muting, then stops; DT blips scale with how short AMP
| RELEASE is (shorter = more blips), also only in the first cycle. Both point at the same
| gap: `dt_trig` (hook 9) gates only ONE of the paths that can start a voice -- the
| "already bound, reuse" dispatch inside FUN_4000f450. FUN_40006820 -- the "voice not yet
| bound, do a FRESH bind and play it" function -- has SEVEN callers in the whole image:
| one INSIDE FUN_4000f450 (0x4000f518, downstream of hook 9's own gate, already covered),
| and SIX completely independent callers elsewhere (0x40043c50, 0x4007eb3e, 0x4008044e,
| 0x4008055c, 0x40093ec0, 0x40096ad4) hook 9 never touches at all. Once a voice goes
| "cold" (its arena slot recycled -- forced quickly by relcut's note-off in OT+FX, or
| naturally by the AMP envelope's own release in DT), the NEXT trig on it needs exactly
| this fresh-bind path, through one of those six other, unguarded callers -- a complete,
| audible voice start, matching the reported symptom exactly: a blip per affected trig,
| until the voice has been "warm" again for a while and every further retrig goes through
| the already-gated reuse path instead.
|
| Rather than chase and gate six separate call sites (fragile -- a seventh could exist
| uncaught), gate the ONE function they all converge on, at its own entry.
|
| FUN_40006820(track: %d1, via %sp@(12)) is its own well-documented 8-track fan-out
| (Session 53): track 0..7 -> real per-track work at 0x40006844 (SR raise, arena-slot
| active-byte clear, `jsr FUN_4000672c` -- THE actual "start the voice" call); track >= 8
| -> recurse over 0..7 by CALLING ITSELF (`jsr %a2@`, %a2 = its own address). That
| recursion means gating single-track calls here is enough by construction: a track>=8
| ("do them all") call is never itself silenced, but each of the 8 recursive calls it
| makes lands back at THIS SAME entry with one track number and gets individually gated.
|
| Detours the first 8 B / 3 instructions (`movel %a2,%sp@- / movel %d2,%sp@- / movel
| %sp@(12),%d1`) -- an exact instruction boundary, room for a 6 B jmp with 2 B spare.
| Replays all three unconditionally (%a2/%d2 pushed, %d1 = track, either way), then for a
| genuinely single-track (%d1 < 8), muted/soloed-out call, skips straight to the shared
| epilogue (0x40006888: pop %d2/%a2, rts) instead of falling into the real per-track work
| -- the same "drop the trig" outcome hook 9 gives the reuse path, now for the fresh-bind
| path too. A track>=8 call, or an unmuted/soloed-in single-track call, falls through to
| `FB_BACK` (0x40006828, stock's own very next instruction, `moveq #7,%d0`) and lets
| STOCK's OWN track<8 test (already right there) decide the rest -- no need to duplicate
| it. The explicit `cmpi.l #8,%d1 / bcc FB_BACK` guard below matters for a different
| reason: without it, a track>=8 call would still reach the MUTE_STATE/SOLO_FLAG test
| with an out-of-range bit position (track+8 up to 16+), which would test a CUE bit
| instead of a MUTE bit and could silence a "do all tracks" call by accident.
|
| %d0 is stock's own scratch here (freshly reloaded via `moveq #7,%d0` immediately after
| our replayed %d1 load on every path that reaches it, before anything else reads it) --
| free to clobber. %d3 is not read by the displaced code or by 0x40006844's own per-track
| work (checked directly in the disassembly) -- also free, and only touched on the
| track<8 path (the track>=8 early-out never reaches it).

    move.l  (12,%sp),%d1                | displaced 3 == track number
| Session 117 FIX: this hook used %d3 as scratch and never restored it.  Stock FUN_40006820
| saves only %d2/%a2 and never touches %d3, so its callers keep live values there across the
| call -- and two do: FUN_40006890 keeps its SAVED SR in %d3 (`move.w %d3,%sr` after its
| 8-track loop), and the frame handler at 0x4000d45a keeps the TRACK NUMBER in %d3 and uses
| it to index the per-track machine table right before `jsr (a0)` through it (0x4000d49c).
| In OTFX-T / DT-T this hook left MUTE_STATE in %d3: SR := mute<<8|solo, or a wild index ->
| a jump through a garbage pointer.  Mute byte 0x25 (T1+T3+T6) gives exactly SR 0x2500, the
| DIRECT JUMP crash screen's SR.  %d2 is free here: the displaced prologue above saved it,
| and every exit (FB_BACK -> 0x40006844 / the clr.l loop, FB_EPILOGUE's pop) rewrites it.

| ============================ hook 11: 0x4000d0ba (THE REL_STATE RACE, FIXED SAFELY) ====
| Session 58 continued again -- user clarification: "first cycle" means the first full
| pass through the pattern after muting; a second pass is clean; unmute-then-remute makes
| it happen again. Direct measurement (multi-retrig BOTLI test) found `relcut` (hook 8)
| misses 3 of 1999 eligible frames: the level-chain computation (0x4000cb4e/cc20/ced0)
| writes a fresh, unmuted-value L/R gain EVERY frame unconditionally; `relcut`'s own zero-
| override only runs when the release loop's REL_STATE bit test is true for a track. A
| stock function (0x4000bf22, part of some larger per-voice-parameter routine, entered
| only ~29 times per 4000 frames) transiently clears a muted track's REL_STATE bit as
| ordinary "a note is starting" bookkeeping -- for exactly one frame, since `pre` (hook 1)
| re-asserts it (`REL_STATE |= silenced`) on the very next pass.
|
| ⚠ FIRST ATTEMPT (detouring 0x4000bf22 itself, OR-ing the silenced set back in right
| before its own store) was ABANDONED after real, alarming evidence: a controlled A/B
| showed a SEVERE (~1900-2000 block), reproducible divergence in OTHER tracks' raw audio
| content -- unlike every other hook in this file (all showing only a handful of blocks of
| benign cross-track timing drift). Chased it with a no-op-only diagnostic detour at the
| SAME site (pure jmp out and back, zero logic): that alone cost only ~74 blocks, proving
| the SITE itself is not to blame. Adding back either a GATE check (`move.l GATE,%d1`) or
| just a bare `SHADOW` read + OR, with NO gate check at all, BOTH still produced severe
| divergence (the gate-free version was, if anything, WORSE, ruling out "reading GATE
| specifically" as the cause too). Whatever this function actually is, it appears to sit
| somewhere disproportionately timing-sensitive -- a handful of ColdFire cycles here moves
| far more than they should anywhere else this project has hooked. Not safe to keep
| pushing on blind; abandoned rather than guessed further.
|
| SAFER FIX: don't touch the writer at all. `0x4000d0ba` -- the release loop's OWN load of
| REL_STATE, confirmed by direct measurement to run EXACTLY once per frame (2000 hits over
| 2000 frames), not once per track (the 8-track test-and-skip that follows just shifts
| this ONE loaded byte 8 times via the carry flag, re-reading memory only once) -- sits a
| few instructions before `relcut`'s own detour, inside the SAME function `relcut` already
| lives in safely. OR the silenced set in immediately after this single load, before the
| 8-track shift-test loop even begins: whatever 0x4000bf22 (or anything else) did to
| REL_STATE in memory, a muted track's bit can never actually read as 0 for this frame's
| pass, closing the exact same race from the read side instead of the write side.
|
| Detours 6 B (0x4000d0ba..0x4000d0c0), an exact instruction boundary, room for a 6 B jmp
| with zero spare. `%d0` holds the freshly-loaded REL_STATE byte and must reach the shift-
| test loop with only bits ADDED, never removed. `%d3` is free here: relcut's own header
| comment (hook 8) already established it is unused anywhere in this function's per-track
| body, and nothing between this site and relcut's own reads or writes it either.

| ==== hook 14: 0x4000b90c (THE PER-STEP LIVE-NIBBLE HAND-OFF TO THE DSP) ===============
| Session 58 continued yet again, part 18 -- the first hook in this thread built on
| RENDERED AUDIO rather than on ColdFire call counts, and the first one aimed at the
| mechanism that actually produces the "echo".
|
| What part 18 measured (see NOTES.md, and tools/emu_echo_dsp.py / echo_blockdiff.py):
| while a track is muted in DT mode NOTHING ever starts a voice -- hooks 9/10 are clean,
| zero `active <- 0xFF` writes post-mute. The audible bursts are the voice that was
| ALREADY sounding when the mute engaged (which DT mode deliberately lets ride its own
| amp envelope) being RE-ATTACKED once per trig step. The signal that does it reaches the
| DSP as word 1 of core 1's 672-word parameter block, which mirrors this per-track byte:

|
| Measured: that store fires on every one of the track's own trig steps after the mute,
| completely unaffected by MUTE_STATE, and each firing coincides with an audible burst --
| until the surviving voice's sample runs out and the playback-position engine frees it
| (clr.b at 0x40008ea6), after which further firings make no sound at all. It is on a call
| path hook 9 never sees, which is why 17 parts of gating the dispatch chain never touched
| this.
|
| The gate: for a silenced track, leave the per-track byte EXACTLY as it was, so the DSP
| is simply never told about the new step. Everything else is untouched -- in particular
| the frame level words still reach the mix, so DT's intended behaviour (the already-
| sounding voice keeps playing and fades out under its own AMP envelope, FX ring) is
| preserved by construction; only the re-attack is removed.
|
| The companion site 0x4000b9bc (a read-modify-write that ORs 0x10 into the SAME byte) is
| deliberately NOT gated: the value the DSP block carries is the low nibble this store
| writes (measured 0x0c0c / 0x0707 / 0x0808 in the block against 0x1c / 0x17 / 0x18 in
| RAM), so the 0x10 flag is local bookkeeping other firmware may read. If a test shows
| bursts surviving this hook, gate that one too -- do not assume it.
|
| Detours 8 B (0x4000b90c..0x4000b914), two whole instructions, both replayed below.
| %d1/%d2 are provably dead here (each is written before its next read: 0x4000b91a loads
| %d1, 0x4000b92e loads %d2) but are saved and restored anyway -- hook 9's own header
| records what a wrong register assumption cost this project once already.
| ASSEMBLED ONLY WITH --defsym LIVE_NIBBLE=1. The A/B below came out NEGATIVE (the hook
| works, the echo does not change), so it is kept purely as a record and must not cost
| the shipped build a single cave byte -- with it assembled unconditionally,
| patch_softmute grows past patch_mutemode's cave and every downstream address has to
| move. To re-run the experiment: add --defsym LIVE_NIBBLE=1, re-enable the detour in
| build_mute_modes.py, and bump patch_mutemode + the three PERSONALIZE arrays by 0x80.

| ==== hook 15: 0x40004c72 (THE PER-TRIG FLAG BITS IN THE DSP FRAME WORD) ===============
| Session 58 continued yet again, part 18 addendum 2. Found by following the ONLY
| trig-aligned host-port word left once hook 14 had frozen the live nibble and proved that
| byte innocent (see NOTES.md): word 30 of core 1's 128-word block, i.e. the per-track
| frame word at 0x8000014c + sel*512 + track*64.
|
| Once per trig, three writes inside the per-frame DSP frame loop build that word up:
|
|     0x40004c72  moveq #3,%d0 / and.l %d1,%d0 / beq 0x40004cb0   <- "did a trig happen?"
|     0x40004c7e  bset #7  -> 0x80 | nibble
|     0x40004c8a  or  #0x10 -> 0x90 | nibble
|     0x40004cba  or  #0x40 -> 0xd0 | nibble
|
| Measured, muted, with hook 14 in place: that 0xd0 goes out on EVERY post-mute trig step,
| unchanged. The only part of the word the mute does reach is bit 8 (0x100), which is the
| dispatched handler's own return value OR'd in later at 0x4000d4b0 -- and hook 9 correctly
| makes that 0, so post-mute the word reads 0x00d4 where an unmuted trig reads 0x01dc. The
| flags still say "a trig is happening on this track NOW"; only the "a voice started" bit
| is missing. Working hypothesis this hook tests: that is what re-attacks the voice DT mute
| deliberately leaves sounding.
|
| The gate: for a silenced track take stock's OWN "no trig this frame" exit (0x40004cb0), so
| the word is built exactly as it is on the 13 steps that carry no trig. Nothing else is
| touched -- the frame LEVEL words are still kept, so DT's intended "the sounding voice
| rides its own AMP envelope and its FX ring" behaviour is unaffected by construction.
|
| Registers: %d4 IS the track index here -- the enclosing loop clears it at 0x40004c38,
| `btst %d4,%d2` at 0x40004d08 uses it as one, and the tail does `addq.l #1,%d4` /
| `lea 0x40(%a1),%a1` / `cmp.l %d4,%d0` against 8. %d0 is free: both exits reload it
| (0x40004c78 `move.w (%a1),%d0`, and 0x40004cb0's own path likewise), so no save/restore
| is needed and no flags hazard exists -- the `btst` is read by the very next instruction.
| The gate reads GATE + MUTE_STATE + SOLO_FLAG directly, exactly as hook 9 does -- NOT
| SHADOW. A first draft used SHADOW and was silently inert: `pre` (hook 1) deliberately
| CLEARS SHADOW in DT mode ("so a live DT -> OT+FX switch re-asserts every note-off"), so
| in the one mode this bug lives in, SHADOW is always 0. Caught only by checking that the
| DSP word actually changed -- the audio A/B alone looked like an ordinary negative result.
| %d0 is the ONLY free register here (%d1 is read at 0x40004c80, %d2 at 0x40004cd8, %d3 at
| 0x40004c6c/0x40004cce, %d4 is the track index), hence the `lsr.l #8` trick instead of
| building a 1<<(8+track) mask in a second register.
