# POLY8T10 selection-flow regression — 9 October 2026

Exact 0.2.6-experimental candidate. T09 and T10 received functional MKII reports; the T10 owner statement and scoped release exception are retained in [owner-release-t10.md](owner-release-t10.md). Current main was rebased after construction; its intervening changes affect no native SDK, firmware engine or compiler input. The source fingerprint remains identical. No firmware, stock tables, raw LCD/RAM data or card image is included here.

## Matched native controls and negative regression

Stock 1.40C MAIN: `164f31224bf61181e3f50e7dec40df9afcae5b16dbf6e4c0d0cc5e986af0a84e`. Separate STATIC and FLEX controls select/reselect in SRC SETUP with sample slots closed; selecting from the double-TRACK machine list leaves that pane visible. Stock sample confirmation leaves slots visible.

The exact T09 MAIN (`68b852601ad8b2579f0b3321c6203624dc2c1dfaacc2237fcf05910f512dae72`) fails the new closed-pool assertion after SRC SETUP assignment; its browser opens on FLEX slots. The corrected solo and full profiles pass the same regression, LEFT/RIGHT browsing, sample YES, PL/1 retention and unchanged Part bytes on reselection.

## Boot regression

Native emulator SHA-256: `eb6edf981e382516897a24de70512da9ddcc29d69db052b8d504367d138aa776`. Fill the complete 10,586,112-byte runtime arena with 0xff before image load and platform-loader execution. The driver requires the poison acknowledgement. Both new images use the boot logo, no CF, MKII, both DSP cores and retained battery RAM; each completes 12 virtual seconds, observes the loaded flag changing zero to one and 72 widget calls with even targets. The port does not reproduce the hardware VEC 03 exception faithfully; the earlier T08 negative control remains separately recorded.

```

## Full shared-machine regression

All four signed machines play audio, the second-POLY refusal leaves Part bytes untouched and dismisses with NO or timeout, and 128 rapid presses at maximum HOLD/REL keep active POLY heads at or below eight while DSP frames advance.

## Compiled and application checks during candidate preparation

- 121 local PC-relative targets resolve correctly.
- Every POLY8 runtime section is initialized in loaded PROGBITS; no allocated NOBITS remains.
- Mandatory ASAN/UBSAN regression passes all 256 mixed AB/FM/VECTOR signature masks.
- Only the `polyui` ELF object differs from the exact T09 build. The shared boot initialization C/assembly, all other requested objects and DSP/resident/ROM package code are unchanged. Both original stock DSP upload ranges match byte-for-byte (A: `09684267438dbbb83163729b2509c5acab3c3d71124b50769d9105b5ce48cb39`; B: `27c26cd3432580cb36c23e34f7dd97c99d668bac8b401df872d288f00074549e`).
- Public tutorial, UI provenance and monochrome captures validate; preservation/source gate passes all 53 guarded edits.
- Current-main TypeScript passes; lint has zero errors and six existing warnings. Source-focused app tests pass 29 assertions; one generated-catalog compatibility assertion fails.
- Before the latest main rebase, the complete app suite reports 1,434 passed and 23 failed assertions. Stale generated catalog/compiled metadata, missing generated media, native comparison/declaration coverage and qualification remain failures.
- Required `npm run check -- --base origin/main` and catalog generation stop at 0.2.6 qualification. The exact 0.2.5 approval was not changed or extended.

## Limits

These two native/browser profiles alone do not replace complete publication coverage. The owner subsequently reported exact T10 “works like a charm” on MKII and approved the exact 0.2.6 source exception in [owner-release-t10.md](owner-release-t10.md). Separately reported hardware recording/load/persistence cases, chip worst-case timing and complete memory bounds remain unverified. Sample audition is not qualified by the software run.

## Release replay on current main — 9 October 2026

The reviewed source was rebased onto main `9ad562bdd9dadea9a72f72042e094592f8a490b6`. Production catalog compositions reproduce the solo T10 MAIN/update and the full eight-module MAIN identities above exactly. The native source remains `a32ed194a288c8847ad0ba110e8bca3bf266ada2227772ef813623b32a21421d`; the compiled SDK source remains `cde470186c57b5f614415bb1d6f7a4161cc07df2d8dd6dc892a7f15df0938394`.

Seven fresh emulator replays pass: solo/full selection flow, solo LOOP/cancellation consistency, solo/full poisoned-arena retained-SRAM boot without CF, solo chord recording/playback/STOP/128 rapid keys, and full four-machine audio/modal/128 rapid keys. All use the same 0xff runtime-arena poison and emulator identity above. Three initial UI fixture attempts failed to import `toolpath`; repairing the fixture's `/work/sdk` link and rerunning those three checks produced passes. The first attempts are fixture failures, not passing results.

The fresh non-POLY builder regression preserves all 38 current-main complete images/refusals. The refreshed Analog BD matrix preserves all 130 build identities and six refusals and matches the browser composer. Another 143 unique retained companion profiles were rebuilt and match the browser composer before their stale native rows were refreshed. Historical comparison records retain their original identities.

The exhaustive native ledger scan passes all 65,536 POLY declaration selections. The fresh 240-profile native/browser comparison has 186 matching builds, 54 matching refusals and zero mismatches; changed stock firmware is refused. The full application check is recorded separately once complete. These software checks do not establish chip deadlines or physical reboot/persistence.

The later rebase onto main `65452618de82a23ea56a7f0cd864044740e0b810` incorporates documentation, contributor metadata and website UI changes. Both native and compiled-SDK source fingerprints remain exactly those above; no firmware build input changes.

The required `npm run check -- --base origin/main` on that rebased release tree passes: 1,513 application tests in 214 files, 87 SDK checks, generated catalogs/licences/machine registry, module contracts, lint, TypeScript and the production bundle. Lint retains six existing warnings. Earlier candidate-preparation failures above are historical and are superseded by this release check.

The locally bundled production firmware worker passes its inspect/build protocol with network APIs unavailable. Its saved 464,596-byte `ELEKLOADER` update is `ad010e3e1ce22e6b1c405a164a5792acd09e744cbfe80f7e930d059ed935da6b`; rereading the saved file confirms that hash. MAIN is byte-identical to T10, both stock DSP uploads and the stock tail are preserved, and repacking the same MAIN with the `POLY8T10` name reproduces the delivered T10 BIN exactly. This is worker-protocol verification, not a browser-button or hardware observation; deployed output is checked after merge.

The final `module:verify -- --all --check` passes every retained module record with zero mismatches and rejects changed stock firmware. The two refreshed Analog BD/Euclid and Analog BD/Sidechain rows retain menus taken from their actual fresh native inputs; no menu was relabeled without a matching native/browser proof.
