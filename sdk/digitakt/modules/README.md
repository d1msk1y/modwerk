# Digitakt modules

Each mod is a folder here: `modwerk.module.json`, README, TESTING, licence, `src/` and `media/`. Create one with `npm run module:new -- my-mod --machine digitakt --author your-github-login`. See [the Digitakt SDK guide](../../machines/digitakt/README.md).

## Module guides

These guides cover the controls, access steps, a practical tutorial and the existing evidence limits. The frontend reads the same descriptions from each module's manifest.
