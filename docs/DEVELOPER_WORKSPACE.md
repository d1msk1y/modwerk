# Creator settings and private report details

Existing published module authors may use the [automatic author-update workflow](MODULE_AUTHOR_UPDATES.md): verified ownership, changes confined to their modules, explicit evidence review and successful checks on the exact source/base permit bot merge and publication. Other changes retain owner review. Existing qualification gates and exact-version owner exceptions are unchanged.

The owner requested GitHub sign-in and module claiming on 4 October 2026. Open **Your account → Developer account**, choose **Verify developer account with GitHub**, and claim the modules listed for that verified handle. The creator settings and its desktop/mobile navigation links appear only after GitHub verifies an author or maintainer listed in the reviewed module catalog. Direct workspace/report links show account verification until that check passes. An unmatched GitHub login returns to the account page without creating a developer identity, handoff or session. No separate developer password or email is needed. Community posting still uses the existing verified member account, and site administration keeps its independent server-side authorization.

## Module ownership and updates

The reviewed catalog is the authority: Octatrack uses the existing module author; Digitakt/Digitone use the v3 manifest's `maintainers`. Claims require GitHub authentication, never a matching forum username or typed handle. The stable GitHub account ID owns the claim. An already-claimed handle cannot be transferred to another GitHub identity by claiming it again. Handle changes or ownership disputes require source review and operator review of the existing link.

Module IDs in community APIs include the machine for elemod modules, for example `digitakt-digihealth` and `digitone-digihealth`; native configuration selections retain `digihealth`. Catalog handles are matched exactly, without case sensitivity. Eligibility is checked again when completing verification and on every developer API request; removing the last catalog match closes existing developer access. The frontend refreshes verification on tab focus and developer sign-out in another tab. Catalog removal of a maintainer immediately removes their module access. The administrator Accounts tab can revoke/restore individual claims with a private reason. A revoked claim cannot be restored by signing in or claiming again.

The creator settings page contains module claims, per-module Ko-fi settings and links to GitHub source and reports. It has no duplicate activity/report inbox. GitHub is the developer home for public replies, report management, source, PRs and releases. Claims are needed for support settings and consent-controlled private context, but registered authors can manage public reports from GitHub without claiming on the website. Login/claims never publish a version or grant administration.

Each claimed module also has a **Your Ko-fi page** field. Save an HTTPS Ko-fi profile URL to show a small **Support the creator on Ko-fi** cup icon beside its author name, or remove the link to hide the button. Current claimed maintainers can also edit it from the module page; legacy published contributions use their verified member owner. Links are stored per machine-qualified module ID and open Ko-fi’s embedded tip panel in a dialog. The panel loads only after a visitor clicks the icon, and an ordinary Ko-fi link remains available inside the dialog. Escape or the close button dismisses it and restores focus. Revocation, suspension or removal from the reviewed maintainer list hides that developer’s link. The owner’s existing `https://ko-fi.com/jannikassfalg` link is already enabled on all reviewed modules authored by `repeat98` (shown as Jannik Aßfalg where the catalog supplies his name). This follows reviewed author metadata rather than a display-name match or a manually maintained list. A saved link takes precedence; removing an owner default saves an explicit empty override so it stays hidden. Changes are recorded in private developer history. Migration **0058_module_creator_support.sql** is applied automatically on merge to `main` by the community Worker deployment, before the backend code is deployed. A migration failure stops deployment.

## Bug reports and private details

On 4 October 2026 the owner requested automatic developer delivery and publication in the Bug Reports forum. The module forms now explicitly post the title, reproduction details, device/base OS and affected module version under the reporter’s username. A single database transaction saves the public thread, the private report/log, the reporter’s follow and developer delivery. The response links to both records. Full configuration, build fingerprint, log/missing-log notes and private replies stay behind the existing reporter/admin/verified-maintainer authorization. The form explains this scope before “Post report”. Stopping private sharing never removes a public thread.

Public reports mention the catalog author and maintainers on GitHub. Developers reply there; Modwerk reads the current public conversation, including existing replies, edits and deletions. Verified Modwerk members can reply from the frontend with their Modwerk username/profile attributed on GitHub. Bell and email report notifications link to the reporter's Modwerk report. The creator settings page no longer has its own activity or report inbox. Existing member bell/email module activity remains available.

Registered numeric GitHub identities can manage their module's mapped public reports by posting commands in GitHub. The signed webhook checks the current reviewed maintainer list, numeric author registry, suspension, revoked claims and existing maintainer-sharing consent. It does not require a website claim or repository write access. Private sharing withdrawal still removes maintainer access and blocks these actions. Private reports, PR comments and issues without a mapped public Modwerk report cannot use these commands.

Private clients without `visibility: "forum"` retain their previous behavior; they never publish silently. For private submissions, maintainer sharing remains off by default, including all historical reports. A reporter can opt in when submitting or from **Your account → Your reports**. Consent covers the report, configuration details, private replies and any attached validated Octatrack log. Withdrawal immediately blocks maintainer reads, replies, status changes and log downloads; prior replies remain visible to the reporter/administrator. It cannot retract copies already downloaded. Earlier reports are not published to GitHub or the public forum.

Digitakt/Digitone reports collect their own model, supported base OS, running state, module version, selected modules and available build fingerprint. They accept no Octatrack log, missing-log requirement, arbitrary attachment or firmware. Octatrack keeps its structured context; an attached `OCTAMOD.LOG` is validated, and since 6 October 2026 it is optional.

Forum module filters and immutable configuration snapshots support all three machines. A snapshot includes its machine, native module IDs and exact recorded versions. Legacy snapshots without a machine remain Octatrack. Copying a snapshot creates a local configuration for that machine using the current approved versions and normal compatibility checks; shared historical versions stay visible in the post. No firmware is shared.

## Backend setup

After an authorized rollout and verified recovery point, apply migrations in order through **0020**. Migration 0020 links newly submitted bug reports to their forum threads; it leaves every historical report private.

Register a GitHub OAuth app with the frontend homepage and the exact API callback `https://<api-host>/api/developer/auth/callback`. Store `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL` in the backend environment/secrets. Never use `VITE_*` variables for OAuth credentials. `APP_URL` must remain the frontend URL; the callback must be on the API origin. Separate frontend/API origins are supported. Loopback HTTP callbacks are allowed only for local development. Missing/invalid configuration keeps developer login closed.

The implementation follows GitHub's [OAuth authorization flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) with state, an HttpOnly SameSite cookie and S256 PKCE. It requests `read:user` and uses a [GraphQL identity query](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql) containing only `viewer { databaseId login }`; it does not request, fetch or store GitHub email or repositories. The GitHub access token is transient and stays on the server. Errors never return provider payloads.

The frontend completes a one-use, 60-second handoff code from a URL fragment with proof saved in the initiating tab. Developer sessions last seven days and store only a token digest and client-secret binding in D1. The browser stores its opaque session by API origin, sends it only to developer/private-report and module support routes and can sign out. As with existing bearer membership, same-origin script compromise can steal this session. Secret rotation and user suspension invalidate developer access. Expired state (10 minutes), handoff and session rows are cleaned hourly. Claims, replies and private audit events persist until an approved operator removal.

Before enabling live login, test the registered callback and return to the actual frontend, denied/expired authorization, logout, undeclared handles, module scope, consent withdrawal and admin revocation. The local regression/browser checks use synthetic identities and a simulated GitHub provider. They do not prove real OAuth-app configuration. Do not log callback query strings, codes, session headers, provider tokens or private report bodies. This document does not authorize creating an OAuth app, deploying or migrating production.

## Manage reports on GitHub

Replying and triaging reports require no fork. Post one command as a new GitHub comment:

```text
/modwerk close configuration <public explanation>
/modwerk close duplicate <public explanation>
/modwerk close not_reproducible <public explanation>
/modwerk close withdrawn <public explanation>
/modwerk reopen <public explanation>
```

Closing without a release marks GitHub `not_planned`, synchronizes Modwerk and queues the reporter's status notification. It makes no firmware-fix claim and sends no release fanout. Commands act only on the module report containing the comment. Edited comments never run commands. Durable receipts serialize writes and prevent redelivery of an old close command from closing a subsequently reopened report. Syntax/version errors receive a public explanation; post a new command after correcting them. Provider failures leave the action retryable through webhook redelivery or a new comment.

After the site's and Worker's release workflows succeed, verify the exact new module version and save/test its compatible firmware download locally. Only after actual verification, post:

```text
/modwerk resolve <published-version> verified-download
```

This is the author's explicit confirmation that the exact published download fixes the report on their unit. The agent must not invent that confirmation. The shared release gate checks the current version, private sharing scope and live `module-releases.json`, posts the public module/version link, closes GitHub and synchronizes Modwerk. A merged PR alone never resolves a report. Missing/stale publication or a GitHub failure leaves the report open. Existing authenticated release-completion and legacy private-report APIs remain available for compatible clients; the frontend no longer presents a second public report-management flow.

The same completion queues idempotent updates for eligible followers/downloaders and a resolution notification for the reporter. Counts describe queued notifications, not confirmed delivery. Push and email retain existing preferences, settling/digest schedules and quotas; hourly inventory sync retries releases. See [the author guide](MODULE_AUTHOR_UPDATES.md).
