// Compares one selection built by Modwerk's browser composer with native octabam's result for it. Reads the original OS in
// memory only. The browser always links the core logger, which native does not have, so the comparison is made on what
// native can produce:
//   * a selection native refuses is refused here, for the same class of reason;
//   * a selection native builds is built here, and the module-owned writes (chooser, descriptors, ROM units, DSP payloads)
//     reproduce native's OS image byte for byte outside the platform writes (arena sizes, the boot call and runtime detours),
//     which depend on where the logger-bearing runtime links;
//   * without a runtime or platform arena reservation, the image is identical outright;
//   * recorder comparisons reserve the same logger arena geometry natively, so every recorder pool literal is compared exactly;
//   * the platform and logger writes never touch a byte a module owns;
//   * when only the logger-bearing Analog BD bootstrap exhausts its guarded
//     pre-boot space, module-owned image parity is still required and the
//     separate browser refusal is retained. No downloadable image is accepted.
